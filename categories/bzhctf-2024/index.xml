      <description>Here is the write-up of CTF A/D - Tampered challenge which I created for the Breizh CTF 2024. This is a Forensic challenge in two steps.
Part 1 Description As part of this Attack/Defense CTF, the administrators assigned us virtual machines hosting various services. One of these machines piqued our interest because we were unable to access the flag. We suspect that a team may have compromised the virtual machine assigned to us before the start of the CTF.</description>

      <description>Here is the write-up of CTF A/D - Stolen challenge which I created for the Breizh CTF 2024. This is a Forensic challenge classified as easy.
Description During an Attack/Defense CTF, we deployed network capture to intercept exploits used by other teams. However, we lack expertise in network analysis. Could you assist us in recovering the flag that was stolen from us? Attachment : capture.pcap Difficulty : Very Easy Resolution For this challenge we have a pcap capture to analyse.</description>

      <description>Here is the write-up of Vault challenge which I created for the Breizh CTF 2024. This is a Pwn challenge classified as medium.
Description During the CTF A/D our team had one of our services compromised, running a binary written in the C of our memories. We no longer have control over the service, so please help us by getting it back... To help you, we only have the recording of the exploit launched by the opposing team, so we hope that&amp;#39;s enough for you.</description>

      <description>Here is the write-up of Usain Bolt challenge which I created for the Breizh CTF 2024. This is a Pwn challenge classified as easy.
Description I&amp;#39;ve devised a nice little binary that&amp;#39;s impossible to bypass. Want to give it a try? Note: The flag is located in the flag.txt file in the root directory. Difficulty : Easy Resolution For this Pwn challenge we only have a binary, no lib :</description>

      <description>Here is the write-up of Vault challenge which I created for the Breizh CTF 2024. This is a Pwn challenge classified as difficult.
Description I&amp;#39;ve created a server so I can temporarily store data without putting it on my disk - great idea, isn&amp;#39;t it? In any case, I&amp;#39;m sure there are no vulnerabilities! Note: A VM vagrant is provided if your exploit works locally but not on the remote server for debugging purposes.</description>
